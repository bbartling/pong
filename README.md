# pong
A Unity concept for learning 2-player game development: build a custom server on the internet that allows two Unity clients to play a game of Pong, using WebSockets to communicate data back and forth.


### Install Websockets support

### Install UniTask

In package manager from git URL:
* https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask.git?path=src/UniTask/Assets/Plugins/UniTask


### Python Fast API app for websocket support

```python
import asyncio
import json
import logging
from collections import defaultdict
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect

'''
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
'''

app = FastAPI()
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

rooms: dict[str, list[WebSocket]] = defaultdict(list)

@app.websocket("/ws/{room_id}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, room_id: str):
    """
    Handles a new client connection for a specific room.
    """
    await websocket.accept()
    rooms[room_id].append(websocket)
    log.info(f"A player joined room '{room_id}'. Total: {len(rooms[room_id])}")

    try:
        while True:
            # --- THIS IS THE FIX ---
            # Wait for raw bytes, not text. This is more robust.
            data_bytes = await websocket.receive_bytes()

            # --- The "Dumb Relay" Logic ---
            # Relay the raw bytes to all other players
            
            broadcast_tasks = []
            for client in rooms[room_id]:
                if client != websocket:
                    # Send the raw bytes, not text
                    broadcast_tasks.append(client.send_bytes(data_bytes))
            
            # --- END OF FIX ---

            # Run all send tasks
            if broadcast_tasks:
                await asyncio.gather(*broadcast_tasks)

    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        log.info(f"A player disconnected from room '{room_id}'.")
    finally:
        # Clean up: Remove the player from the room
        rooms[room_id].remove(websocket)
        if not rooms[room_id]:
            # Delete room if it's empty
            log.info(f"Room '{room_id}' is now empty and closed.")
            del rooms[room_id]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    # Make sure to include the http="h11" fix from before
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, http="h11")

```
